This repository contains the solution to the  Analytics Vidya Loan Prediction problem along with the datasets.<br/>
In this machine learning project the main goal is to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer detail provided.<br/>
The cateogy of variables used in the models are:
* Application details <br/>
* Credit history <br/>
<br/>
Some variables like age and gender are not used by credit card companies for loan solicitation. However the analysis showed great trends with these variables so they were leveraged in the final models.<br/>

Two different approaches have been implemented here: 
* Logistic regression 
* Random forest
